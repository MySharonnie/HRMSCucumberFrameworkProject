Key Requirements:
- The Cucumber framework must be developed from scratch.
- While you can refer to your existing framework for guidance, direct copy-pasting is highly discouraged to promote a deep understanding of the process.
- The framework should follow the Page Object Model (POM) to ensure a clean and maintainable code structure.
- Ensure all necessary dependencies for the project are included.
- Utils classes should be developed to handle reusable methods and utilities.

Purpose:
- To practice using the Cucumber framework and learn how to implement user stories in a real-world scenario.
- To understand the interconnectivity of the framework, including how different classes are related and how they work together.
- To build a functional testing framework while enhancing your knowledge of automation testing and behavior-driven development (BDD) practices.

Key Checkpoints for the Framework:
- Runner Class: Able to execute the test cases.
- Common Classes: Organizing reusable code across the framework.
- Config Read & Config Properties Files: To load configuration settings.
- Constants: Define constants used throughout the framework.
- Page Initializers: Initializing page objects.
- Pages (Page Factory): Implementing page objects using the Page Factory design pattern.

User Story: Login Validation for HRMs Portal
As a user attempting to log into the HRM portal,
I want clear and specific error messages during the login process,
So that I can understand if my login attempt failed due to missing fields or incorrect credentials.

Acceptance Criteria:
If a user attempts to log in with an empty username field, the system should display an error message stating "Username cannot be empty."
2. If a user attempts to log in with an empty password field, the system should display an error message stating "Password is empty."
3. If a user enters incorrect login credentials (either the wrong username or password), the system should display an error message stating "Invalid credentials."
4. The error messages should be clear and easily visible to the user, ideally placed near the respective input fields.
5. After displaying the error message, the system should allow the user to correct their input and attempt to log in again.
User Story: Add Employee to HRMS
As an admin user,
I want to be able to add an employee to the HRMS application, either with or without providing a unique employee ID,
So that the system can generate or accept a unique employee ID and store the employee's details properly.

Acceptance Criteria:
An admin user should be able to add an employee to the HRMS application without providing an employee ID. The system should automatically generate a unique employee ID for the new employee.
  - Required fields for this process:
    - First Name
    - Middle Name (optional)
    - Last Name
2. An admin user should also have the option to add an employee to the HRMS application by providing a unique employee ID.
  - Required fields for this process:
    - First Name
    - Middle Name (optional)
    - Last Name
    - Employee ID
3. The system should provide appropriate error messages or prompts for users who attempt to submit incomplete or invalid employee information. Error messages should be:
  - Clear
  - Easily visible
  - Placed near the respective input fields.
